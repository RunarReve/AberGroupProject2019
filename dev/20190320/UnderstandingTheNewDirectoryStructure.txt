The "presenting" folder (and subdirectories) has been deleted, but its purpose is replaced by the "dev" folder. Each week will have its own folder within dev, named after the date of the official tutorial meeting (Eg. "20190320"). Any work you produce or significantly edit (i.e. not just correcting a typo or two) should be uploaded into the folder named after the upcoming official tutorial meeting.

I have temporarily renamed all original files and directories with the associated username as the prefix (eg. "ffz_[...]"). This is just for the purpose of aiding the restructuring process; do not follow this naming convention with files and directories in the future.

Initially, I have just dumped all files/directories from the original presenting folder into this week's folder under dev. We should all aim to move our older files to the appropriate week's folder in the near future, but that will be a focus after everybody has updated to the new directory format, and probably after this week's official tutorial. I have taken and uploaded screenshots of the original presenting subdirectories under dev/20190320/OriginalPresentingFolderScreenshots, in case this is useful during the process of moving old files back to their associated week's folder.
