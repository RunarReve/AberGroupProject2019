1) Merge test 001 and test 002
2) Reformat the test spec as follows:
    -Create a set of test data in the appendix of the test spec;
    -Redo the desktop side to go through the process of implementing the aforementioned data;
    -Redo the mobile to refer to the aforementioned data;
    -Ungroup tests with the same functional requirements to make order of tests more logical for the testers (where appropriate).
3) Decide on the baseline tags/filters (NOT the flair ones) 
4) Create test(s) for all tags in the desktop system
5) Reimplement tag tests for the mobile system
6) Go over tests related to inputs and see if you can make consistent invalid input tests (where appropriate) for all of these areas
7) Make sure test numbers are chronological
8) Remake test spec document to fix formatting issues identified just prior to previous submission 
9) Add changes to change history section, update to "For Review", update version #, etc.
