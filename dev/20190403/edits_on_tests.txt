-fix on tests

inputs needs inputs, eg. SE-007 add pub: "Bar46"....All variables...
   and should not have no exactly same inputs, eg. SE-007, SE-008, SE-009
   
talk to UI to flash out what has changed

move test, like add, search, and remove to be after each other, so they are after each other.

-For all
	Delete town, safe 
	Don't look at memes during meeting
	if(easter != true)
		DON'T LOOK AT MEMES
