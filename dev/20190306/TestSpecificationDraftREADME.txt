Hey all!

The Test Spec. document is all updated now with the tests that Sid uploaded yesterday and my own updated tests (you'll probably be pleased to know we dropped about 30 tests after I trimmed the mobile test section down!). There's still some stuff that needs to get done to it before 5PM today (besides blog posts!) - things that will be impossible for me to do as I'm still away from Aber -, so I would really appreciate it if you could handle these small tasks for me. In short:

1) Please do a mini review of the Test Spec. (just check some format stuff, read the intro section, check a couple of tests... Not the whole thing again!)

2) If there are any problems (eg. typos) please fix the small ones then n' there, and otherwise make a note of things to fix later

3) Finally, please do the following:
	-Edit the top of the document such that the version number is "1.0" and the status is "Released"
	-Add a new row to the Document History section, explaining that the document passed testing
	-Rename the filename to "TestSpecGroup09"
	-THEN export it as a PDF (so we have a published copy, and an editable one)
	-Create the directory "test_specification" under docs/
	-Upload the PDF in this directory, and the regular document somewhere else (eg. under presenting/)
	-Update the config_refs file (under config/) with some new lines explaining the PDF location (as above)

As I say, if you could get this done before 5PM today (preferably a bit earlier) that'd be really great, as there's a chance our files won't be checked, or we lose organisation marks, if they're not there by the end of the working day. Cheers in advance! :)
