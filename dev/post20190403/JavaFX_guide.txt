Everything that you need to edit is under dev\20190428\GUILink
ad under the pacage GUI.

.fxml files is the place where everything GUI happens, like making, diplaying stuff
*Controller.java is the "brain" of the .fxml with similatr names where functions will be to the GUI

TODO:

	.fxml
	Format so everything isn't on the same line to be more readable
		eg: 
		    <Button layoutX="483.0" layoutY="346.0" mnemonicParsing="false" text="Save and Exit" />
	
	
	Add IDs to the Buttons for java to know what button it is (fx:id ="...")
		eg:
			fx:id="backBtn"
			
	Add Action to the buttons for java to know what function to call when the button is pressed (onAction="#...")
	remember the # in front of the function name
		eg: onAction="#moveBack"
		
	move Text up to under onAction, not important, but makes it a bit easier to find if need to edit
	
	
	
	*Controller.java
	
	Create the buttons, needs to be the same name as the fx:id in connected .fxml (public Button ...;)
		eg:  public Button backBtn;
	
	Make function with same name as the onAction(without the #)(public void moveBack(ActionEvent event)throws IOException)
	Depending on what function it is:
	If it is a change scene button copy the other moveScene buttons in the pagage, eg: mainMenueController
		then change the string on the first line of function to the .fxml to move to
	If it's something else, just make a empty function for now
	
	
	Note: 
		for what connects to what, see the "UI page link.pub" 
		when importing ActionEvent, intellij often imports "java.awk.event.ActionEvent"
			this is the wrong one, change to "javafx.event.ActionEvent"
